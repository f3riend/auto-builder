**Reasons for development :**
Because I am a programmer, I use my computer intensively and a lot of files accumulate and for this reason I format my computer periodically and every time I format it takes a lot of time to reinstall the programs.

Apart from that, when I was in high school, I was in the programming department and there were a lot of computers in our workshop and our teachers would periodically format the computers and install the programs for us.

Another reason is that I change computers a lot, my own computer, my brother's computer, my friends' computers, etc.
