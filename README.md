# Auto Builder

**Reasons for development :**
Since I am a programmer, I use my computer intensively and a lot of files accumulate, so I format my computer periodically and it takes a lot of time to reinstall programs every time I format it.

Apart from that, when I was in high school, I was in the programming department and we had a lot of computers in our workshop and our teachers wanted us to format the computers periodically and install the programs ourselves.

Another reason is that I change computers a lot, my own computer, my brother's computer, my friends' computers, etc.

I converted my code into an exe file and put it on my flash drive and use it when I need it.

**Used:**
```bash
pip install windows-curses
```
